<h1>Bouncing Ball Challenge</h1><br>
<h4><i>MITxPro Javascript coding challenge to create animated balls, define boarders, and reverse direction.</i></h4>

<h3>Description:</h3> 
After learning the foundations of Javascript, CSS, and HTML, I was given the challenge of animating a pre-designed ball to move along the X and Y axis, define X and Y boundaries in which the ball can exist, and change the direction of the ball movement when it reached an X or Y boundary. After coding the one bouncing ball, I used what I learned about boundaries and animated objects to code four bouncing balls that moved on the x or X axis and changed color every time they hit their boundary.
